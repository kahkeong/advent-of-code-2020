# **Advent Of Code 2020**
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## **How to run**
- You can run all solutions by running "run_all.py". It takes ~100 seconds to run through all my solutions (result will be "not implemented" if a solution to a question is not implemented)
- Or you can just run the individual file

## **Notes**
Please change the content of the input files as each individual will receive different input for each question.

I only got 43/50 questions completed. Below are the list of questions which I did not implement a solution
- 13\. part2
- 20\. part1 and part2
- 24\. part1 and part2
- 25\. part1 and part2
